        <div class="text">Kalpana Chawla was an Indian-American astronaut who made history as the first woman of Indian
            origin to venture into space. Born on March 17, 1962, in Karnal, Haryana, India, she developed a passion for
            flying at a young age and pursued her dream of becoming an astronaut.

            After completing her early education in India, Kalpana moved to the United States to pursue higher studies.
            She earned a Master of Science degree in Aerospace Engineering and a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering from the
            University of Texas at Arlington. During her time in the United States, she became a naturalized American
            citizen.

            Kalpana Chawla began her career in the aerospace industry as a research scientist at NASA's Ames Research
            Center. In 1994, she was selected as an astronaut candidate and joined NASA's astronaut corps. She underwent
            rigorous training and preparation for space missions.

            <br><br>Chawla's first space mission came in 1997 when she served as a mission specialist on the Space
            Shuttle Columbia (STS-87) flight. She made history as the first woman of Indian origin to go to space. The
            mission focused on conducting scientific experiments in microgravity.

            Tragically, on February 1, 2003, during her second space mission on the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-107),
            disaster struck. The shuttle disintegrated during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, resulting in the
            loss of all seven crew members, including Kalpana Chawla.

            Kalpana Chawla's legacy as a pioneering astronaut and an inspiration to millions of people around the world
            continues to this day. Her passion for space exploration and her dedication to pushing boundaries remain an
            inspiration to future generations, particularly women pursuing careers in STEM fields.

            <br><br>In recognition of her contributions and sacrifice, Kalpana Chawla has been posthumously honored with
            numerous awards and accolades. Her life story serves as a reminder of the indomitable human spirit and the
            pursuit of knowledge and exploration beyond our earthly bounds.
